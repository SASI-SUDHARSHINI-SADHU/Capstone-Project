# SpaceX Machine Learning Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the success or failure of the first stage landing after Falcon 9 rocket launches using machine learning techniques. The project folder contains several Jupyter Notebook files, each focusing on different aspects of the project.

## Files Overview

1. **SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Part_5.jupyterlite.ipynb**: This notebook contains the final part of the project, where machine learning models are built, trained, and evaluated to predict the first stage landing outcome.

2. **Spacex.csv**: This CSV file contains the dataset used in the project, including features such as FlightNumber, PayloadMass, FlightHistory, LaunchSite, and Outcome.

3. **jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb.jupyterlite.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques to understand the characteristics and patterns present in the dataset.

4. **jupyter-labs-eda-sql-edx_sqllite.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates data exploration using SQL queries within JupyterLab environment to analyze the dataset.

5. **jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb**: This notebook showcases data collection techniques using APIs to gather additional data for analysis.

6. **lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.jupyterlite.ipynb**: This notebook explores the geographic locations of launch sites and their potential impact on the first stage landing outcome.

7. **labs-jupyter-spacex-data_wrangling_jupyterlite.jupyterlite.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on data wrangling techniques to clean, preprocess, and prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered SpaceX launch data including payload mass, flight history, and launch site information.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed and visualized the dataset to gain insights into the characteristics and patterns present.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, transformed, and prepared the dataset for machine learning modeling.

4. **Model Building**: Developed machine learning models using logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to predict first stage landing outcomes.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model hyperparameters to improve performance using techniques such as grid search and cross-validation.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).
